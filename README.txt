Welcome to my "Usual Expenses" application !!!

The goal of this React application was to build an expense tracker.
The main point of this app is the capability of adding an expense (title, sum of money & date)
and later viewing the newly added expense in the graph below based on the selected year.

For the graph part of the app, I used a built-from-scratch Chart component. 
It lets the user peruse his added expenses throughout the years and it can also give a detailed
list of his expenses below the chart.

I built individual standalone components for each logical item in the app to better maintain 
and reuse the code.

Check out the custom favicon *wink *wink

Hope you enjoy !!!
